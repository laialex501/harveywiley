This repository is for Project 4 of EEP 153 by Team Harvey Wiley. This readme will be updated as the project develops. 

The topic of this project is Ethiopia in the years 2011 and 2013 based on the data provided to the class. Due to some issues with unit conversion and local foods, some rows and columns were dropped in the data.

The pieces of the project can be split into relatively independent components, which are used to inform policy decisions. These components are split into their own folders.

Each component is individually commented and documented within the relevant files. Please start with the main file for each folder. 

The main file for Demand Estimation/ is estimation_example.ipynb. The goal of Demand Estimation/ is to estimate a system of demands for Ethiopian foods.

The main file for Nutrition/ is FDC foods.ipynb. All .csv files are supporting files that hold relevant data. The goal of Nutrition/ is to estimate the nutritional value of Ethiopian diets, determine if Ethiopians were meeting certain nutritional requirements, and acquire information on any nutritional deficiencies that may require correction.
